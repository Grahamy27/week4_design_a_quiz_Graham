# week4_design_a_quiz_Graham
As a coding boot camp student
I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
So that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
The acceptance criteria includes:
When the quiz I've created starts a timer when the button is clicked.
Once the timer has started I will be presented with a set of questions,
when I answer correctly I will see a green notification stating "correct"
if its wrong I will see a red "incorrect" notification.
When answered incorrectly I will lose 5 seconds in time.
When all the questions are over the game will be over, I will then be requested to enter my initials and receive a score.
I have also linked my github account. The portfolio will be updated as I complete further projects. I have provided clickable links that will take you to certain sections of my page and also if you click on boxes there will be links to my previous projects.
